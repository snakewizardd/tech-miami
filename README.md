# Tech Miami Static Website

This repository contains the **static website elements** for [Tech Miami](https://tech-miami.com). These files are the output of the build process from **MkDocs** and are deployed to serve the live site.

## Repository Purpose
This repository is dedicated to the static content that powers the website. It does **not** include the source files or configuration used to generate the site. Those will be made available in a separate repository at a later stage, or simply will be appended to this repo.


## Current Status
- **Website**: [Tech Miami](https://tech-miami.com)
- **Build Tool**: [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- **Deployment**: Hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Planned Updates
In the future, the repository may:
1. Include source files for the MkDocs project.
2. Utilize GitHub Actions for automated build and deploy workflows.

## Contribution
At this stage, contributions are not accepted as the repository is focused on static output.

If you have questions or need to report issues, please reach out via the [Tech Miami website](https://tech-miami.com).
