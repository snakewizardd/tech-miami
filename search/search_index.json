You can also use a tool like <code>curl</code> to test the API endpoints: <pre><code>curl http://localhost:5000/greet\ncurl http://localhost:5000/users\n</code></pre> This should return the greeting message and the list of users, respectively.</p>"},{"location":"simple-api/#expanding-the-example","title":"Expanding the Example","text":""},{"location":"simple-api/#adding-authentication","title":"Adding Authentication","text":"<p>To make your API more secure, consider adding authentication using libraries like Flask-JWT-Extended.
